            <strong>Project:</strong><br> <br>
            The project is an individual assignment. The purpose is to put all the class concepts together and create a website. The project is divided into parts. The due dates are listed on the schedule.

        <div class="labBox">
            <strong>Labs:</strong><br> <br>
            Labs are individual assignments. The lab assignments include posting your files to Github and validating them online. Students must resolve the errors they when validating before turning in the lab. Labs with validation errors or labs submitted incorrectly will receive a grade of zero. Late work will not be accepted.

    <div class="examsContainer">
        <strong>Exams:</strong><br> <br>
        Exams evaluate your recall and understanding of the course material, as well as your ability to apply it to new situations. There will be two exams in this course. Exam dates are posted on the course schedule. It is your responsibility to be present for each exam on the date posted. There are no re-issues or make-ups. All course content is considered for exam questions - assigned readings, labs, lectures. <br> <br>
        Exams will be timed and must be started at the beginning of class. If you show up for class late you will receive less time to complete the exam. If you show up after the exam completes, you’ve missed the exam.

        <strong>Academic Integrity</strong> <br> <br>
        The course honor code represents our commitment to Academic Integrity in a programming course. I drafted the class honor code to avoid academic negligence - situations where students are unaware that their actions are actually a form of cheating. Our honor code remedies this problem by clearly stating the expectations of Academic Integrity for this course. It states:
        <ul>
            <li>All work is my own. Answers on all student work, assignments (labs, projects, lecture questions, etc…) and assessments (exams, etc…) are my own individual work (except where collaboration is explicitly permitted).
            </li>
            <li>I will not share answers. I will not make answers (either my own or the professor’s) to work, assignments (labs, problem sets, projects, papers, homework, etc…) and assessments (quizzes, exams, tests, etc…) available to anyone else in or out of class. This includes posting them on the web or sharing them in test banks.
            </li>
            <li>I will not misrepresent my ability. I will not engage in any activity which misrepresents or falsifies my knowledge of the subject matter and therefore improves my grade dishonestly. This includes unsanctioned test aids and copying homework.
            </li>
            <li>I will give credit. I will always pay attribution to my sources, and not misrepresent the works of others as my own. If you get code from the web, you must cite it like you would any source in an academic paper.
            </li>
            <li>I accept the honor code and its consequences. I understand and accept that that all work I submit is subject to the honor code, and if I violate this honor code I my instructor is obligated to report me to the University’s office of Academic Integrity.
            </li>
        </ul>
